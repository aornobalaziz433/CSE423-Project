Doomsday Journey: ##Game Description
Doomsday Journey is a 3D action game built in Python using PyOpenGL, set in a Mad Max: Fury Road-style post-apocalyptic desert. You control an armored car equipped with a roof-mounted machine gun, racing across an open desert arena filled with randomly placed stone boulders that act as solid obstacles.
Gameplay
Drive and Shoot: Roam freely across the desert, shooting zombies with your machine gun to survive.
Collect Coins: Grab floating coins scattered across the arena to earn points.
Avoid Obstacles: Steer clear of stone boulders, as crashing into them costs you a life.
Fight Zombies: Zombies attack your car. If one reaches you, you lose a life.
Increasing Difficulty: As you kill more zombies, they spawn faster and become tougher (faster speed and more health).
Game Over: The game ends when you lose all your lives.

##Objective
Survive as long as possible in the harsh desert wasteland, racking up points by collecting coins and defeating zombies while avoiding collisions and attacks.
